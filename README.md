# Fire Emblem: Heroes Damage Calculator / Battle Simulator
Interactive Fire Emblem Heroes Combat Simulator and Damage Calculator, as seen on [KageroChart](https://kagerochart.com/damage-calc). Quickly assess the strength of your build vs the entire FEH Hero Roster!

## Notice
This project is gradually being open-sourced for community involvement and management.
Parts of the application might be missing, or documentation may be sparse. If you have
any questions while we get this rolling, please shoot me an email. [winsomniak@gamedex.io](mailto:winsomniak@gamedex.io)

At this point, the project has diverged dramatically from the legacy simulator,
but as always we thank [rocketmo](https://github.io/rocketmo) for all of the hard work!

Cheers,
